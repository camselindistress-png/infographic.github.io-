    <h2>What Are Microplastic-Eating Bacteria?</h2>
    <p>
      Some bacteria have developed the ability to break down plastics, especially polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is commonly used in products like water bottles and food packaging.

    <h2>Meet Ideonella sakaiensis</h2>
    <p>
      One such bacterium is <strong>Ideonella sakaiensis</strong>. This microbe produces enzymes that can degrade PET plastic into smaller molecules. These molecules are then used by the bacteria as a food source.

    <h2>Genetically Modified Bacteria in Saltwater</h2>
    <p>
      In 2023, researchers made a breakthrough by genetically engineering a saltwater-loving bacterium, <em>Vibrio natriegens</em>, to break down PET plastic. They used DNA from <em>Ideonella sakaiensis</em> and inserted it into a plasmid—an independent genetic sequence—that was then introduced into <em>V. natriegens</em>.
      This allowed <em>V. natriegens</em> to produce plastic-eating enzymes on its cell surface. The genetically modified bacterium successfully broke down PET microplastics in a saltwater environment at room temperature. This work, supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, marks the first time an organism has been engineered to break down PET in ocean-like conditions.

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      This discovery offers hope for reducing the global plastic waste problem. Microplastic-eating bacteria could potentially help clean up polluted environments. However, this method is not a complete solution, as many types of plastics are not biodegradable and require different approaches for recycling or disposal.
    </p>

    <h2>Science in Public Spaces</h2>
    <p>
      To raise awareness about this scientific breakthrough, I proposed creating a mural or infographic near the beach where human activity and littering directly impact our oceans. The mural would serve not only as a piece of public art but also as an educational tool. Our goal is to engage beachgoers with beautiful, meaningful visuals that teach them about science and inspire eco-conscious behavior. By placing the mural in a highly trafficked area, we aim to reduce littering and increase appreciation for scientific solutions to environmental issues.
